## What is it?
Extractor is our new feature which captures all the commits you have done on certain projects
without accessing your code directly.
It creates a JSON file which gets the info from metadata stored in your commits.

Other information such as remote URLs, file names, emails, names is hashed. The Extractor will recognize if two commits belong to the same file but won’t know the files name. Moreover, the JSON output is saved on your computer and you can check for yourself what data is extracted and if it crosses your employers’ NDA before uploading it to EXP Timeline.
Once uploaded, the JSON file is classified as user content and is processed according to the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.lmc.eu/en/terms-of-services/specific-terms-of-services/techloop/).

```

Extracted JSON files are located in export folder (`./export/*`)
